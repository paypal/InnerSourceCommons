## About InnerSourceCommons.org
InnerSourceCommons.org (aka ISC) utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of inner source through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of inner source patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

Interested individuals and companies are welcome to participate and contribute content to the ISC. In general, contributed content will be made available under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) attributed to InnerSourceCommons.org.
