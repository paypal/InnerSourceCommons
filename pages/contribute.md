If you've got a story about how InnerSource has worked inside your own company, we'd love to hear from you. Because we are hosting InnerSource Commons on using GitHub Pages, you can [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourceCommons/tree/master) to these pages that adds your Case Study to the collection.

InnerSource At PayPal - There is a great case study in the free [Getting Started With InnerSource](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/getting-started-with-innersource.csp) eBook. You can also view the [slides](/assets/files/AntiSilo-OSCON-US-2015.pdf) from Cedric Williams' OSCON 2015 talk.
