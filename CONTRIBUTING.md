# Welcome - Please Contribute!

InnerSourceCommons (ISC) is a collaborative effort to help explain the value of and patterns for inner sourcing - that is, using open source techniques inside of your organization.

ISC uses both this public website at https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/ and an accompanying wiki
site, both hosed at GitHub pages.  The website is primarily for high level information, 
well-reviewed content, and pointers to more information.  The wiki pages are a collaborative space 
that welcomes the input of all helpful inner and open source participants.

## How To Propose A Change

For the website, open a normal [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourceCommons/tree/master) against the GH Pages / Jekyll based web content.

For the [wiki](https://github.com/paypal/InnerSourceCommons/wiki), simply login with your GitHub Username and click the Edit or New Page buttons at the top of any page.
