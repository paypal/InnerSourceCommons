    </div>
    <b>Raimund Hook</b>
    <p>
As InnerSource and DevOps Specialist at EXFO, Raimund has a corporate mandate to introduce and develop InnerSource in his organization. He is bringing his skills honed from his 20-year career into building tools and trying to foster a community of developers across the business. A technical generalist, Raimund has experience with a vast array of technology from hardware to deep network stacks, virtualization to cloud building, and a plethora of programming languages to several automation frameworks.
A passionate believer in Automation, Raimund believes that there is a solution for most mundane tasks – somebody simply needs to take the time to implement it. Unfortunately, he’s found out, automating people is less of an ‘easy target’. He’s admittedly learning along the way and has found that sharing his experiences is part of the InnerSource way. Raimund joined Ontology Systems in London in late 2015, which was later acquired by EXFO in 2017. Prior to working at EXFO, he spent 11 years working for Internet Solutions in South Africa, a converged Telecommunications provider. There, he held various positions culminating in leading a team responsible for building and maintaining fulfilment and provisioning solutions for the business.
