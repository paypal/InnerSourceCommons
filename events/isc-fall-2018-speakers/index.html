    <p>
I've been involved in innersource since the second summit, which Danese Cooper asked me to join.  I have been hooked ever since! I'm currently the Director of Enterprise Intelligence at PayPal, where I created a centralized set of tools and standards so that teams can innersource effectively across business units and acquisitions, removing years of backlogged features. I'm responsible for Enterprise Search, Unified DataHub, ALM (application Lifecycle Management), Monitoring and Notifications.
</p>
<p>
I re-architected the FDI (Failed Developer interactions) monitoring program to be more accurate, resilient and reliable. I also worked with DevX team on the creation of a Unified Product Model for End to End Developer Experience.
In addition, I open sourced the unified search tool <a href="https://github.com/paypal/seazme" alt="Seazme">Seazme</a>, while engaging with other companies in its adoption outside of PayPal.

As InnerSource and DevOps Specialist at EXFO Inc., Raimund Hook has a corporate mandate to introduce and develop InnerSource in his organization. He is bringing his skills honed from his 20-year career into building tools and trying to foster a community of developers across the business. A technical generalist, Raimund has experience with a vast array of technology from hardware to deep network stacks, virtualization to cloud building, and a plethora of programming languages to several automation frameworks.
A passionate believer in Automation, Raimund believes that there is a solution for most mundane tasks – somebody simply needs to take the time to implement it. Unfortunately, he’s found out, automating people is less of an ‘easy target’. He’s admittedly learning along the way and has found that sharing his experiences is part of the InnerSource way. Raimund joined Ontology Systems in London in late 2015, which was later acquired by EXFO in 2017. Prior to working at EXFO, he spent 11 years working for Internet Solutions in South Africa, a converged Telecommunications provider. There, he held various positions culminating in leading a team responsible for building and maintaining fulfilment and provisioning solutions for the business.
