### April 21-22 2016 in London, England

Companies today already understand that Open Source is necessary.

Less is understood about how to effectively use Open Source principles on internal development. This is the challenge that InnerSource seeks to address.

### Are you working to implement InnerSource in your organization?

Each of our journeys is unique. Please consider sharing a short (10 minute) case study at the Summit. We would love to hear about your experience bringing InnerSource practices to your organization, particularly what your current objectives are, what experiments you are running, what you have learned so far (from successful or failed experiments), what culture changes you are trying to create, and challenges you haven't yet solved.

Looking forward to seeing you there!
