John has participated in numerous industry and academic events in Ireland and gave various keynote addresses. He holds a degree from the University of Limerick.</p>

<p>Professor Brian Fitzgerald</p>

<p>Professor Brian Fitzgerald is Director of Lero – the Irish Software Research Centre, where he previously held the role of Chief Scientist.  Prior to that he served as Vice-President Research at the University of Limerick. He also holds an endowed professorship, the Krehbiel Chair in Innovation in Business &amp; Technology, at the University of Limerick.

<h3 id="what-is-the-innersource-commons">What is the InnerSource Commons?</h3>

<p>The InnerSource Commons (<a href="http://innersourcecommons.org">InnerSourceCommons.org</a>) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from almost a hundred companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the <a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule">Chatham House Rule</a>), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.</p>

<h3 id="who-should-attend">Who should attend?</h3>

<p>The InnerSource Common Summits welcomes software professionals at all levels, from executive level manager to software developer.  The program targets software development managers and executive managers in particular because adopting InnerSource requires significant efforts to make changes in the organization—whether these are implemented top-down or bottom-up. If you or your organization is adopting, or considering adopting, InnerSource, then attending the InnerSource Summit is the best thing you can do.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-i-get-from-this-event">What will I get from this event?</h3>

<p>The three key reasons to attend the InnerSource Common Summits are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption</li>
  <li>Share your experiences and get help with your challenges</li>
  <li>Network, network, network! The InnerSource Commons is an excellent place to network with likeminded people, all of whom are passionate about making InnerSource a success in their respective organizations!</li>
</ul>
